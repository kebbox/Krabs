# Krabs
Molecular calculation and molecular dynamic project

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Krabs is untested on other development environments.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone -- https://github.com/kebbox/Krabs`.

on the krabs directory run 'MakeProject.bat', this will create a vs solution.

## Example

start by loading a .mol file (in the 'example_molecule' you can find one) using the command :
>load <filepath/filename.mol>

then run a MC calculation of that model:
>total energy
